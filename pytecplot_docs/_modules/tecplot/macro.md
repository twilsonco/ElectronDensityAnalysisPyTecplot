        Parameters:
            name: (`str`): Name of the macro function to run. This name
                is not case sensitive. Must be a non-zero length `str`.

            parameters: (`str`): Any parameters which the quick macro
                requires. Pass `None` (default) for macro functions which require no
                parameters. The parameters are passed as a string which includes
                the parenthesis. For example, if the macro function takes a
                string parameter and int parameter, pass
                **'("string_parameter_name", 2)'** Default: `None`

        Macro functions must be defined before they are used. Typically they
        are defined in the 'tecplot.mcr' configuration file which is read
        when |Tecplot Engine| is initialized. Macro functions
        may also be available in the Quick Macro Panel when the Tecplot 360 GUI
        is running.

            macro functions.

        .. warning:: Zero-based Indexing

            It is important to know that all indexing in |PyTecplot| scripts are
            zero-based. This is a departure from the macro language which is
            one-based. This is to keep with the expectations when working in the
            python language. However, |PyTecplot| does not modify strings that are
            passed to the |Tecplot Engine|. This means that one-based indexing
            should be used when running macro commands from python or when using
            `execute_equation() <tecplot.data.operate.execute_equation>`.

        This command splits the input into individual commands and runs them one
        at a time. See the |Tecplot Macro Scripting Guide| for details about
        |Tecplot 360|'s macro language.

        .. warning::
            The $!VARSET command is not supported. Tecplot Macro variables should be
            converted to Python variables.

        .. warning::
            Intrinsic variables (that is, variables with pipes such as
            ``|DATASETFNAME|``) are not supported. If you need to use an intrinsic
            variable in the macro command, add the macro command to a text file and
            call `execute_file`.

        See the |Tecplot Macro Scripting Guide| for more information about raw data
        and intrinsic variables.

        The following command will perform the same operations as the
        `Hello, World! example <hello_world>`::

        Parameters:
            command_processor_id (`str`):  A unique string used to
                determine the API to call when an extended macro command is
                processed. API's are provided by add-ons or applications
                that extend the Tecplot macro language.

                Typically this will be the name of an add-on or application,
                followed by a version number. For example: 'CFDAnalyzer4'.

                Each application or add-on may provide one or more unique
                command processor ID strings corresponding to different API's,
                or different versions of an API.

                For example, a file converter add-on responsible
                for converting DXF files for Tecplot might provide two versions
                of an API:
                "DXFCONVERTTOOL-1.2", and "DXFCONVERTTOOL-2.0".
                In that case either of these strings would be passed in the
                *command_processor_id* parameter to indicate the version of the
                API to use.

            command (`str`): The command to run.
            raw_data (`str`): Raw data required for the command, if any
                (default: `None`).

        acceptable.

            It is important to know that all indexing in |PyTecplot| scripts are
            zero-based. This is a departure from the macro language which is

        .. note:: **Absolute and relative paths with PyTecplot**

            Relative paths, when used within the PyTecplot API are always from
            Python's current working directory which can be obtained by calling
            :func:`os.getcwd()`. This is true for batch and `connected
            <tecplot.session.connect()>` modes. One exception to this is paths
            within a macro command or file which will be relative to the |Tecplot
            Engine|'s home directory, which is typically the |Tecplot 360|
            installation directory. Finally, when connected to a remote (non-local)
            instance of Tecplot 360, only absolute paths are allowed.

            Note that backslashes must be escaped which is especially important for
            windows paths such as ``"C:\\\\Users"`` or ``"\\\\\\\\server\\\\path"``
            which will resolve to ``"C:\\Users"`` and ``"\\\\server\\path"``
            respectively. Alternatively, one may use Python's raw strings:
            ``r"C:\\Users"`` and ``r"\\\\server\\path"``
