        must be loaded and the server must be accepting requests. To turn on the
        server in Tecplot 360, go to the main menu, click on "Scripting ->
        PyTecplot Connections...", and finally check the option to "Accept
        connections." Make sure the same port is used in both Tecplot 360 and the
        python script. For more information, see :ref:`Requirements for Connecting
        to Tecplot 360 GUI <connections>` Example usage::

                tcp://localhost:7600
            Connection established.

        To activate the :ref:`TecUtil Server <TecUtilServer>` addon in Tecplot 360
        on start-up, first create a macro file, named something like:
        *startTecUtilServer.mcr*, with the following content:

        .. code-block:: none

            #!MC 1410

                    ListenOnPort = 7600
                )"

        Then run Tecplot 360 from a command console with this file as one of the
        arguments::

            > tec360 startTecUtilServer.mcr

        .. warning::

            Adding the macro command above may cause a port binding conflict when
            using multiple instances of Tecplot 360. A single port can only be
            bound to one instance of the :ref:`TecUtil Server <TecUtilServer>`. You
            may still add this to the ``tecplot.add`` file which will be run
            everytime, but it must only be activated when Tecplot 360 is running
            interactively, i.e. not in batch mode. To do this, check the value of
